[comment]: <> (### Is this approved by Riot?)

[comment]: <> (Fashion Forward conforms to both the [general Riot Developer policies]&#40;https://developer.riotgames.com/policies.html&#41; and the [League Client development policies]&#40;https://developer.riotgames.com/league-client-apis.html&#41; and it is registered and approved on Riot's developer portal.)

[comment]: <> (While this doesn't mean that Riot explicitly approves the application or supports it in any way, it makes it increasingly unlikely that using this application will risk your account.)
